This is the story of Pierre The Pear. He was born on an abandoned land in the Netherlands.
He loved to eat mangoes while staring at Van Gogh’s paintings. His favourite past time was sleeping under the tree in the park. 
He made his living by modeling in still-life paintings for artists.  He was in high demand.
His favourite place to do homework is Mcdonalds. In his previous life, he was a preist. 
Then tragically one day he got too close to the edge of a fjord and the wind threw him off. He lives on happily as a cup of pear sauce.
